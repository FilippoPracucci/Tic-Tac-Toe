# Tic-Tac-Toe

This game is a variant of the classic [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe), in which 2 players can play one against the other, placing alternately a mark per turn in the spaces of a 3x3 grid; the player who succeeds in placing three of his marks in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal row first is the winner.

## Variation

The variation consists on the fact that every player will never have on the grid more than 3 marks simultaneously, which means that starting after placing the third personal mark, at each turn a random mark of the player in turn will be removed, before he can put the next one (so his fourth on the grid).
